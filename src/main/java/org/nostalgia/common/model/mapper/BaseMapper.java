/**
 * Interface for mapping between source and target types.
 * <p>
 * The {@code BaseMapper} interface provides a contract for converting objects of one type into another,
 * as well as converting collections of such objects. This interface is useful for implementing data
 * transformation layers between different representations, such as mapping between two objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Example Usage</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class UserToEntityMapper implements BaseMapper<User, UserEntity> {
 *
 *     static AdminRegistrationApplicationCompleteRequestToUserMapper initialize() {
 *         return Mappers.getMapper(UserToEntityMapper.class);
 *     }
 *
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface should provide specific mapping logic for transforming a source type
 * into a target type. The default method for mapping collections leverages the single object mapping method.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <S> the source type
 * @param <T> the target type
 */

     * <p>
     * This method defines the logic for converting an instance of the source type {@code S}
